# Complex Example

> The channels for this example can be imported using `Stack/Groups/Complex Example.xml`


The "complex example" is designed to show how to 
* distribute incoming messages to different channels based on simple filters
* unite messages from multiple channels into one channel

To do that, the following structure has been implemented:

<figure style="text-align: center;" id="ComplexExampleChannels">

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">The structure of the complex example</figcaption>
